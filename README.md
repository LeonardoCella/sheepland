# sheepland

This is a desktop version of table game sheepland. 

The program works either via RMI and via Socket.

Users' disconnections are properly managed and reconnections are possible thanks to hidden session keys.
There are two possible way of interactions the first one by command line and the second one by a static graphic user interface.

All the code is commented according to the Javadoc standard, for any doubts you can ask me by email. 
In order to allow you to faster understand the program structure I leave in a proper folder (/media/uml) all the uml images.

As I mentioned, for any information feel free to contact me at: \mailto{leonardocella@gmail.com}
